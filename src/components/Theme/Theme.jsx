      "God creates dinosaurs, God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man, Man destroys God. Man creates dinosaurs."

This iconic dialogue from Jurassic Park provided the perfect theme for Team SANSKRITI's ECLECTIKA'23. 

When you're surrounded by the undisputed rulers of the planet, life should find a way to survive! 

Are you excited??? 
Ooohh, Aah,_
That's how it always starts. But then later, there's running and screaming.

We just want to say Hold on to your butts in Jurassic World jargon.

Get ready for Time Travel into the prehistoric era! Fasten your seatbelts.
